TITLE:: CodeRelay
summary:: relays code to network peers and History
categories:: Relay classes
related:: AddrBook, Peer, Hail, Registrar, SynthDescRelay, etc.

DESCRIPTION::
When evaluating code, CodeRelay sends the code as string to all the peers in its AddrBook. The This can be used to create a shared code history in collaborative live coding performances.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: new
create a new CodeRelay

ARGUMENT:: addrBook
an AddrBook where Peer-s are registered

ARGUMENT:: post
a flag whether to post code to the post window. default: false

ARGUMENT:: oscPath
the oscPath to use for relaying. default: '/codeRelay'

ARGUMENT:: encryptor
an (optional) encryptor for codeStrings.

ARGUMENT:: codeDumpFunc
an optional function to relay the code strings. default nil will be replaced by a standard function which relays to all peers in the addrBook.

returns:: a new CodeRelay


INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: onlyWorkingCode
When true, coderelay sends only code that has evaluated correctly.

returns:: a Boolean

METHOD:: private
When true, coderelay does not send code. Useful for temporary experiments that would clutter a performance history.

returns:: a Boolean

METHOD:: post
When true, coderelay will post to post window.

returns:: a Boolean

METHOD:: free
remove coderelay by removing codeDumpFunc from interpreter and freeing its oscFunc.
returns:: the coderelay


METHOD:: addHistory
add History such that coderelay writes own code and relayed code into History.
returns:: the coderelay

METHOD:: removeHistory
remove History from coderelay.
returns:: the coderelay

METHOD:: makeOSCFunc
internal method, makes the OSCFunc that receives shared code.
returns:: the coderelay

EXAMPLES::

code::
// make an address book
a = AddrBook.new; a.addMe;
// make a hail, so other peers on other laptops can join the network
h = Hail(a);

// make a shared relay
c = CodeRelay(a);
c.dump;

// start History and make its gui for testing
History.start.localOff;
History.makeWin(20@20);

// code relay now sends to History window:
c.addHistory;

// silly code lines that should show up in History window,
// or on connected peers if present
1 + 2;

42 == 23;

// remove coderelay and free its resources.
c.free;
h.free; // same for hail and History
History.end;
