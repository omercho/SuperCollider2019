DESCRIPTION::
Registrar allows centralised registration of participants in a Utopia based network music application. Registrar can run on one of the nodes in a subnetwork, or on a separate node. (The latter can be useful where stability is a concern.) Registrar keeps track of link::Classes/Peers:: joining and leaving a subnetwork, and their online status, and distributes this information to all members.

By using different OSC paths multiple subnetworks can exist on the same physical network. Each participant in a subnetwork should create a link::Classes/Registrant:: with the same path.

Registrar holds an link::Classes/AddrBook:: as an instance variable. This can be passed to other Utopia objects on the Registrant's node, and will be updated as appropriate.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: new
Create a new Registrar.

ARGUMENT:: addrBook
An optional link::Classes/AddrBook:: which this instance will use to store discovered link::Classes/Peer::s. Users can pass this to other Utopia objects, and know that it will be updated as appropriate. If nil, one will be automatically created.

ARGUMENT:: period
The interval in seconds between pings to Peers being sent. Peers which have not responded for > (2 * period) seconds will be marked offline.

ARGUMENT:: authenticator
An optional authenticator, which is used to authenticate other Peers attempting to join the system. This should be an instance of a subclass of link::Classes/NMLAbstractAuthenticator::, such as link::Classes/ChallengeAuthenticator:: or link::Classes/GroupPasswordAuthenticator::. If nil  Registrar will create an instance of link::Classes/NonAuthenticator:: (no authentication). 

ARGUMENT:: oscPath
An OSC compliant path in the form of a link::Classes/Symbol:: or link::Classes/String:: used to identify this subnetwork. By using different paths multiple subnetworks can exist on the same physical network. In simple cases the default ('/register') can be used.

returns:: A new Registrar instance.


INSTANCEMETHODS::

private:: ping, makePeer, makeOSCFuncs, checkOnline, init, makePeer

METHOD:: free
Free this object and its link::Classes/OSCFunc::s. After this, this Registrar (and probably its AddrBook) should not be used.

METHOD:: addrBook
Get this Registrar's link::Classes/AddrBook::. This can be passed to other Utopia objects.

returns:: An link::Classes/AddrBook::.
